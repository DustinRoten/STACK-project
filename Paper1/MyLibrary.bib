	abstract = {The performance of the steady-state air dispersion models AERMOD and Industrial Source Complex 2 (ISC2), and Lagrangian puff models CALPUFF and RATCHET were evaluated using the Winter Validation Tracer Study dataset. The Winter Validation Tracer Study was performed in February 1991 at the former Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site near Denver, Colorado. Twelve, 11-h tests were conducted where a conservative tracer was released and measured hourly at 140 samplers in concentric rings 8 km and 16 km from the release point. Performance objectives were unpaired maximum one- and nine-hour average concentration, location of plume maximum, plume impact area, arc-integrated concentration, unpaired nine-hour average concentration, and paired ensemble means. Performance objectives were aimed at addressing regulatory compliance, and dose reconstruction assessment questions. The objective of regulatory compliance is not to underestimate maximum concentrations whereas for dose reconstruction, the objective is an unbiased estimate of concentration in space and time. Performance measures included the fractional bias, normalized mean square error, geometric mean, geometric mean variance, correlation coefficient, and fraction of observations within a factor of two. The Lagrangian puff models tended to exhibit the smallest variance, highest correlation, and highest number of predictions within a factor of two compared to the steady-state models at both the 8-km and 16-km distance. Maximum one- and nine-hour average concentrations were less likely to be under-predicted by the steady-state models compared to the Lagrangian puff models. The characteristic of the steady-state models not to under-predict maximum concentrations make them well suited for regulatory compliance demonstration, whereas the Lagrangian puff models are better suited for dose reconstruction and long range transport.},

@article{lohman_modeling_nodate,
	title = {Modeling {Mercury} in {Power} {Plant} {Plumes}},
	abstract = {Measurements of speciated mercury (Hg) downwind of
coal-fired power plants suggest that the HgII/(Hg0 + HgII)
ratio (where HgII is divalent gaseous Hg and Hg0 is
elemental Hg) decreases significantly between the point
of emission and the downwind ground-level measurement
site, but that the SO2/(Hg0 + HgII) ratio is conserved.
We simulated nine power plant plume events with the
Reactive \& Optics Model of Emissions (ROME), a reactive
plume model that includes a comprehensive treatment
of plume dispersion, transformation, and deposition. The
model simulations fail to reproduce such a depletion in HgII.
A sensitivity study of the impact of the HgII dry deposition
velocity shows that a difference in dry deposition alone
cannot explain the disparity. Similarly, a sensitivity study of
the impact of cloud chemistry on results shows that the
effect of clouds on Hg chemistry has only minimal impact.
Possible explanations include HgII reduction to Hg0 in
the plume, rapid reduction of HgII to Hg0 on ground surfaces,
and/or an overestimation of the HgII fraction in the
power plant emissions. We propose that a chemical
reaction not included in current models of atmospheric
mercury reduces HgII to Hg0 in coal-fired power plant plumes.
The incorporation of two possible reduction pathways
for HgII (pseudo-first-order decay and reaction with SO2)
shows better agreement between the model simulations and
the ambient measurements. These potential HgII to Hg0
reactions need to be studied in the laboratory to investigate
this hypothesis. Because the speciation of Hg has a
significant effect on Hg deposition, models of the fate and
transport of atmospheric Hg may need to be modified to
account for the reduction of HgII in coal-fired power plant
plumes if such a reaction is confirmed in further
experimental investigations.},

The conditioner contains a furnace to thermally decompose compounds at temperatures up to 1000C and a liquid scrubbing system to remove particulates and interfering gases, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The diluter module is used at sources where mercury levels are above the calibration range of the measuring instrument. The pump module draws the sample through the system, exhausts the waste scrubber liquid, and maintains a constant pressure in the analyzer. Field tests were conducted at a coal-fired power plant. Good correlation was obtained between the interface/photomatic analyzer and a reference manual procedure. Instrumental results ranged from 1.74 to 6.96 micrograms/cu m, with mean value of 4.23 micrograms/cu m; reference method results varied from 1.60 to 7.25 micrograms/cu m, with a mean value of 4.66 micrograms/cu m.},

data from 1981 to 2003 that was collected by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis
Center. For the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we used the data that was collected in
Mauna Loa from 1965 to 2004 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The
developed statistical models take into consideration trends and seasonal effects. The
quality of the prediction process is illustrated using the actual data.},
